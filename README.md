HI THERE !

Overview
This project demonstrates how to connect the Django backend framework to the React frontend library. It provides a simple data entry application where data is retrieved from the backend and displayed on the frontend using the Axios library.

Project Rationale
Utilizing React with Django offers several advantages:

Leverages React's Single Page Application (SPA) optimization combined with Django's robust features.
Both React and Django have extensive community support and provide immediate assistance whenever needed.
Allows for a clear separation between frontend and backend logic, enabling independent deployment and scalability.
Project Components
This project comprises two distinct parts:

Backend: Creating APIs using Django-Rest-Framework.
Frontend: Interacting directly with the API using React JS.
Setup Instructions
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Backend Configuration:

Ensure Django is installed.
Use pipenv for managing the virtual environment.
Install required packages:
pipenv install djangorestframework
pipenv install django-cors-headers
Backend Development:

Define models using models.py.
Implement serializers in serializer.py.
Configure views in views.py for handling GET and POST requests.
Set up endpoint URLs in urls.py.
Backend Deployment:

Make migrations: python manage.py makemigrations.
Apply migrations: python manage.py migrate.
Create a superuser: python manage.py createsuperuser.
Start the server: python manage.py runserver.
Frontend Setup:

Create a React app: npx create-react-app frontend.
Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontend.
Install Axios for frontend-backend communication: npm install axios.
Frontend Development:

Utilize Axios in App.js to fetch and display data.
Project Usage
Start the Django backend server.
Enter data on the backend to reflect changes in the React frontend.
